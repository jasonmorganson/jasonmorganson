Looking forward to sculpting a future where the two can truely coexist.

I want to be there at the moment of sugularity when they come together


As the world moves forward into the mobile driven "Post-PC" future and
platforms shift increasingly the web takes on a greater role and will
play a critical part in whats to come. As the largest deployed distrubution
system in the world it is the target with the highest number of addressable users.
As it advances and evolves to compete with mobile and native systems it has drawn 
some of the biggest talent and I would like to be a part of that.

I am a capable person who has proven to be able to learn quickly and indepentendly



I have always been interested in computers, they have fascinated me since I was young.  

The ability to take something from your mind and translate it through an keyboard and into realistic actions is powerful.

There are a few things in life that no matter how far we advance in technology I don't think that I will ever overcome my amazement; one of those things is "Hello World", that first moment in a program where you have communicated your thought into language that the machnie can understand and respond back to you. Each time I take that step in a new language it still amazes me that my thoughts are being translated through what ammounts to words that the computer can understand in a language that has been negociated by people wiser than myself into bits that a set of microprocessors can use to communicate through electrons to process and interpret back to me to display what I disired. The language of speaking to the computer may vary, but like travling through different countries the goals and techniques never do. Learning new languages in computers is in many way easier than in verbal laguages because while they may state they are or appear to be different parlences, in many ways they are really just differenc dialects all speaking the same basic language in slightly different tounges with maybe an extra accent or a little bit of slang here and there.

Learning new languages has always been exciting. I have always enjoyed it and am willing to try any ones that prove thier merits to be usefull. While there are reasons that there will always be low level machine languages around and they may always be the fastest option when you are looking to develop natively. I think that we have finally made it to the point where the architecture of the web is ready to become the mainstream approach or at least we are close and it is soon to be. Its for that reason that i have been drawn to the  languages of the web the most. The power of the audience they enable is aluring and the promise of fullfilling the everelusive goal of writing once is too great of an elixer to pass up.

New technologies like Node.js have been powering my fantisies of late. 

I started out my higher education persuing a Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering and then quickly switched to Computer Science when I realized that it was the software not hardware that fascinated me most about computers.

My Junior year Clarkson started its Software Engineering program and I found what I was truly after in school.

While the hardware that powers the technology we use is fascinating, I saw even then that it would always take a supporting role to the software. Today, the hardware incresingly slides out of view hidden more and more by industrial design. Its not the cuircuits or chips that we interact with on a daily basis it's the interface draw on the screen by those electrical bits. The possibilities that are available in what gets drawn to the screen are exciting. The ability to create virtually anything inside a peice of software is amazing.

I decided to work with my Father on a house that we built and sold   

I have run crews for other people and myself.

I have experienced first hand the trials of small bussiness.  

All the while, I have been keeping up to date on computers and technology.

I have learned, built and expirementated with many different languages and programs. The knowledge that I have gained allong the way has given me experience to go along with my degree.
