My name is Jason. Nice to meet you. I am a Software Engineer at heart and by training. My skill set is varied and deep. I am a capable person who has proven to work independently and productively. I have managed projects at a high level while paying attention to minute details simultaneously. I am adept at working through tough problems and figuring out solutions.

## I like to solve problems.

I have always been interested in computers; they have fascinated me since I was young. I have been a programmer for 23 years, since I was 9 and started writing BASIC. The ability to take something from your mind, translate it through a keyboard into text and perform realistic actions is powerful. I have been constantly drawn to learn more. I studied at Clarkson University in Potsdam, NY and then later at Champlain College in Burlington, VT.

## This is my passion.

During my studies an opportunity came up that pulled me away. The real estate market was booming at the time and I decided to work with my Father on a house we built and sold. After which, due to high demand for my services I continued to operate a construction company. While it may not be in the technology field, starting and running a company in any field requires the same business mechanics. I have experienced first hand the trials of small business and understand what it takes to succeed. At the same time I was running the business I took classes online. All the while, I have been keeping up to date on computers and technology.

## I learn fast and I work hard.

I have always dreamt of changing the world and of finding an opportunity to do so. As much as I enjoy my current job and field it doesn’t offer me that chance and I don’t want to miss the opportunity. I feel it is an exciting time to be in technology and I want to be at the forefront of what is happening. It seems as if there has never been a better time to be in computers and technology. 

## I am dynamic and adaptable.

I would really like to help you build something amazing. Let’s talk about working together sometime soon, here are my contact details:
